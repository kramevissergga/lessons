      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hajime Isayama's Attack on Titan features many iconic Titan types, and each Titan variant is unique. Here are
        all 11 types of AoT Titans explained.</p>
      <img src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/03/1d148-16784975858118-1920.jpg" alt="Rumbling">
      <p>
        Each of Attack on Titan's titular monsters play an irreplaceable role in the popular anime series, as they are
        the main antagonistic force that Eren and his friends must defend the world against. The Titans Attack on Titan
        shows vary based on certain characteristics and can be placed in separate Titan types based on these. Part of
        what makes these Titans so compelling is that these types greatly vary from the mindless Pure Titans to the more
        sophisticated Titan shifters like the Female Titan.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Attack on Titan Titans are certainly a formidable
        force in the context of the series. There have been plenty of untimely losses at the Titan's hands, including
        the brutal death of Eren's mother Carla, and more mythos surrounding the monsters and their capabilities have
        come to light throughout the course of the show. These revelations have made the Titan threat even more
        intimidating, with some Titan Types like the Colossal Titan being able to wreak mass destruction. The epitome of
        this comes when Eren merges with the Founding Titan and begins the Rumbling. Here's every type of Titan in
        Attack on Titan explained and how they operate in the confines of the show.
      </p>
      <h3>What Are Titans In Attack On Titan?</h3>
      <img
        src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/attack-on-titan-titans.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=767&dpr=1.5"
        alt="Some regular titans">
      <p>Throughout the course of Attack on Titan, it is revealed that a Titan’s sole purpose is to seek out and devour
        humans, although they do not necessarily derive food-based sustenance from human flesh. While pain tolerance
        varies among the Titans, most of these humanoid monsters display little or no signs of intelligence, making them
        easy to trick or deceive. However, there are exceptions in the form of <a target="_blank"
          href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-abormals-reason-why-connie-mother/">a few mysterious Abnormal
          Titans</a> and the infinitely more powerful Nine Titans, who possess the ability to strategize, detect traps,
        and turn the odds in their favor during a fight. It is also interesting to note that varying types of Titans
        fought during the Great Titan War, which was a result of a series of civil wars in the kingdom of Eldia over
        1,700 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Titans also differ in terms of their reaction to pain, as some Titans remain
        completely unaffected by agonizing injuries, whereas others might scream and writhe in pain. While almost all
        titans possess enlarged heads and exceptionally large mouths, the nature of their teeth varies. The <a
          target="_blank" href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-last-panel-ending-most-tragic-twist/">gut-punching
          ending of the
          Attack on Titan manga</a> saw Eren plummeting towards his final moments, as
        he dies after a single blow that separates his head from the spine. After Eren's death and Ymir's decision to
        relinquish her power, all Titans return to their human forms, rendering the species dormant.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="pure-titans">
      <h2 class="chapter__title">Pure Titans</h2>
      <img
        src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sonny-attack-on-titan-pure-titan.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=767&dpr=1.5"
        alt="pure titan">
      <p>
        The first type of Titan are Pure Titans. Referred to as Muku no Kyojin, Pure Titans range from two to 15 meters
        in height, resembling humans but with varying levels of enlarged forms. The majority of the observed Titans both
        in the manga and the anime belong to this category, their overarching feature being their inability to form and
        process thoughts. Despite being <a target="_blank"
          href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-creation-how-made-ymir-sand/">made
          similarly to Attack on Titan's other Titan types,</a> Pure
        Titans are mindless and tend to attack humans without discrimination. They are often dangerous due to their
        sheer numbers, formidable strength, and enormous size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pure Titans have been used as weapons of war since
        they appeared, first by Eldia and presently by Marley, and can only be killed by slashing the nape of their neck
        with two swords. A notable example of a Pure Titan would be the humanoid dubbed Bean, who first appeared when
        the gates of Trost District were broken by <a target="_blank"
          href="https://screenrant.com/attack-on-titan-fan-art-colossal-eren-yeager/">Attack on Titan's epic Colossal
          Titan,</a> after which,
        Eren and the rest of the human forces are able to reclaim the district. Bean was one of the two Titans kept
        alive for the sake of experimentation in an attempt to better understand the nature of these beats and their
        innate weaknesses.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="abnormal-titans">
      <img
        src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/abnormal-titan-attack-on-titan.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=767&dpr=1.5"
        alt="Spider-like titan">
      <p>
        The Abnormal Titans are one of the most bizarre Titan types. Abnormals are Pure Titans that display unusual
        behavior and intelligence, allowing them to perform unpredictable moves during a fight. Abnormals often tend to
        ignore nearby humans and move on to strategic locations in order to inflict more damage, while being adept at
        performing tremendous leaps, running, speed-walking, and in a few cases, communicating in human tongues. An
        Abnormal Titan’s ability to form thoughts and speech has been chronicled in the diary of Ilse Langnar, who had
        run into a hesitant Titan amid an expedition massacre.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the diary was found by Hange Zoë, along with
        other members of Levi’s squad, it is revealed that the Titan addressed Ilse as “Lady Ymir”, mistaking her for <a
          target="_blank" href="https://screenrant.com/ymir-fritz-attack-titan-mysteries-origin-explained/">Attack on
          Titan's mysterious
          Founder Ymir Fritz,</a> while greeting her with great respect. Confused
        by the possibility that a Titan can experience human-like emotions, Ilse became increasingly frustrated during
        her attempts at communication, which ends with the Titan crushing her skull whilst shedding tears. The existence
        of the Abnormal Titans forces humans to approach the beasts with a more nuanced perspective, as not all Titans
        are mindless killers with the aim to devour human flesh. Another example of an Abnormal is Connie Springer’s
        mother, who had assumed Titan form in Ragako village and uttered the haunting words, <span>“welcome
          home.”</span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-block" id="nine-titans">
      <img
        src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/attack-on-titan-the-nine-titans.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=767&dpr=1.5"
        alt="The nine titans art">
      <p>
        Having absorbed fragments of Ymir’s powers, <a target="_blank"
          href="https://screenrant.com/attack-on-titan-nine-titans-ranked-power/">Attack on Titan's incredibly powerful
          Nine Titans</a> are
        nine unique Titan types whose powers have been passed down through the Eldians for nearly 2,000 years after
        Ymir’s death. This Titan type includes some of the most iconic Titans of the series like the Armored, Colossal,
        and Female Titans. Each of the nine has its own name and distinct abilities, although all of them can transform
        into their inherited Titan at will. The Nine are able to retain human intelligence even after transformation and
        have access to advanced Titan abilities that include the targeted regeneration of specific body parts and
        accelerated healing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from this, the heights of the Nine vary greatly in their Titan form: for
        instance, the Cart and Jaw Titans stand at 4 and 5 meters respectively, while the Colossal Titan is a towering
        60 meters. These heights remain definite for all inheritors, who, if they happen to possess two or more Titan
        powers, find themselves being overpowered by one over the other. A good example of the same is <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-eren-founding-titan-transformation-ymir-explained/">Attack
          on Titan's villainous lead Eren,</a> who possessed both the 13-meter Founding Titan and the 15-meter Attack
        Titan, but his eventual Titan form was 15 meters.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="founding-titan">
      <h3>Founding Titan</h3>
      <img
        src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/the-founding-titan-attack-on-titan-1.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=767&dpr=1.5"
        alt="The founding titan art">
      <p>
        Also known as Progenitor Titan and the Coordinate, the Founding Titan is the first of all the Titan types with
        the ability to create and control others, modifying the memories and bodies of the <a target="_blank"
          href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-show-coordinate-ability-explained/">Subjects of Ymir
          with its "Coordinate" Ability.</a> Although the Founding Titan is currently in possession of Eren, its power
        can historically only be harnessed by members of the royal family. This Titan possesses several abilities,
        including titan creation and control, memory alteration, and telepathic communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power to command
        other Titans was unwittingly used by Eren in an attempt to protect Mikasa, while anatomical manipulation was
        used by an Eldian king to make the Subjects of Ymir immune to a rampant epidemic. In terms of height, the
        Founding Titan stands at 13 meters, although it can potentially grow taller when its full abilities are tapped.
        In the War for Paradis Arc, Jean travels to the head of the Founding Titan and detonates explosives after
        wrapping them around its neck, which completely severs off the Titan and the Source of all living matter.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="armored-titan">
      <h3>Armored Titan</h3>
      <img src="https://media.comicbook.com/2020/12/attack-on-titan-1247753.jpeg?auto=webp" alt="Armored titan">
      <p>
        Reiner Braun’s Armored Titan stands at 15 meters and has a slight <a target="_blank"
          href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-armored-titan-brock-lesnar-wwe/">resemblance to WWE Superstar Brock
          Lesnar.</a> In terms of appearance, the Armored Titan has thick, hardened plates all over its body, acting as
        a natural defense against external attacks including cannon hits, steel blades, and vertical maneuvering
        equipment, making it the most defensively strong of the Titan types. In addition to this, these AoT Titans are
        able to harden their arms and feet, creating sharp claws in the process. Armored Titan's only weakness seems to
        be the areas on the back of its joint that are armorless in nature and the fact that the armor is not capable of
        withstanding high-power weaponry, such as the Mid-East Allied Forces’ artillery. In the end, during the War for
        Paradis arc, Reiner's Armored Titan form is dissipated after all Eldian Pure Titans are transformed back into
        people.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="attack-titan">
      <h3 class="titan-info">Attack Titan</h3>
      <img
        src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjFiZGYzOGEtOTI4Ni00YWIwLWFmZmUtZjlkM2E0ZDUyZDExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjAwNDUxODI@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg"
        alt="Attack titan">
      <div class="titan-info">
        <p>
          In Eren's possession right up to his death, and acting as Eren's default Titan form, the Attack Titan can
          receive memories from both past inheritors and those yet-to-come, which is described by Zeke Yeager as
          <span>“the power to transcend time.”</span> This power actually enabled <a target="_blank"
            href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-show-eren-eat-dad-grisha/">Eren to paradoxically
            manipulate his dad Grisha</a> to cause his own Titan creation. Although these memories allow a glimpse into
          the future and the lives of those who would inherit the Attack Titan subsequently, they are often incomplete,
          blocking the user from perceiving the larger picture. In terms of appearance, the Attack Titan is 15 meters
          tall
          and is characterized by a highly muscular build and fleshless jaws. It is also interesting to note that the
          Attack Titan is the only one of the known Nine Titans that has not been confirmed to have any unique abilities
          on its own, but it can be given the hardening ability with a specialized serum.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="beast-titan">
      <h3>Beast Titan</h3>
      <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRhU7GkZXwKTwGWe9wpoAV4-ytl9dUJG0YMwQ&usqp=CAU"
        alt="Beast titan">
      <p>
        Taking on a beast-like appearance, the Beast Titan is slightly larger than most and exhibits animal traits that
        depend upon the user. The Beast Titan is known to have displayed traits common in elks, birds, bulls, and wolves
        among others, <a target="_blank"
          href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-season-2-weird-opening-beast-explained/">as shown in
          Attack on Titan's Season 2 opening,</a> while Zeke Yeager’s Titan assumed
        ape-like form. It is also interesting to know that Zeke’s spinal fluid was used to transform Falco into a Titan,
        which later gave his Jaw Titan falcon-like epithets similar to that of the Beast Titan. Moreover, Zeke’s Beast
        Titan possessed the formidable ability to throw objects with great accuracy and destructive capability, notably
        during the battle of Shiganshina District wherein most of the Survey Corps was wiped out with crushed rocks.
        Also, due to his royal blood, Zeke’s Beast Titan held the ability to turn Subjects of Ymir into Pure Titans.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="cart-titan">
      <h3>Cart titan</h3>
      <img
        src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/the-cart-titan-attack-on-titan.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=767&dpr=1.5"
        alt="Cart titan">
      <p>
        Possessing greater endurance levels than Pure Titans and other members of the Nine Titans, the Cart Titan can
        partake in longer missions without having to pause for rest. This Titan’s absorption resistance allows it to
        maintain its beastly form and wear armaments such as battle armor, mobile machine gun platforms, and cargo
        packs. As opposed to most bipedal Titans, the Cart Titan assumes a quadrupedal form, which potentially hinders
        the user to walk upright in human form. In terms of weaknesses, the Cart Titan has lower defenses and slower
        regenerative abilities as opposed to the others, and more likely to be taken down by a fatal blow. However,
        similar to the Jaw Titan, the Cart Titan possesses immense speed, such as when it defeated Zeke and Reiner
        during the Battle of Shiganshina while catching a <a target="_blank"
          href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-mikasa-ackerman-shogun-levi-reason/">member of Attack on Titan's
          strongest family
          Levi</a> off guard.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="colossal-titan">
      <h3>Colossal Titan</h3>
      <img class="titan-face"
        src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/03/07/attack-on-titan-the-final-season-part-1-teaser-trailer-stills-11-1678213341670.jpg"
        alt="Colossal titan">
      <p>
        Users of the largest Titan type, the Colossal Titan, can control the energy produced during their transformation
        to create various effects, such as when Bertolt attacks Trost District and his transformation triggers a
        powerful wind blast. The Colossal Titan is also able to create a mushroom cloud of dust and rubble, which led to
        the death of many Survey Corps members during the Battle of Shiganshina District. Also, as indicated by its
        name, the <a target="_blank" href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-colossal-titan-height/">Colossal Titan is
          known for its
          enormous size</a> and physical prowess, as it holds the
        ability to topple the outer gate of Wall Maria with a single kick.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Colossal Titan also possesses the
        unique ability to control the steam emitted from its body, burning and repelling attacks in proximity in the
        process. During his final moments in a fight against Armin and Mikasa, Eren's Titan form engages in a
        hand-to-hand fight with the former in his Colossal Titan form. While Eren bests Armin in terms of physical and
        strategic prowess, Armin manages to immobilize him long enough for Mikasa to enter his Titan's mouth and kill
        him before kissing him goodbye.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="female-titan">
      <h3>Female Titan</h3>
      <img class="beautiful-titan-face"
        src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/female-titan-attack-on-titan.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=767&dpr=1.5"
        alt="Female titan">
      <p>
        Much like the Founding Titan and Zeke’s Beast Titan, the Female Titan is able to exercise a certain degree of
        influence over Pure Titans through a scream-based ability. As the Female Titan can attract Pure Titans to
        itself, Annie Leonhart used this ability to gather Titans on Paradis Island during the <a target="_blank"
          href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-chapter-33-wall-terrifying-secret/">fall of Attack
          on Titan's Wall Maria.</a> However, this attraction ability has its disadvantages: once arriving near the
        Female Titan, the others tend to attack and eat its body, which can be countered with vertical maneuvering
        equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Female Titan is also known for its tremendous endurance and mobility and can harden its skin
        at will in order to shatter blades of ultrahard steel upon contact. Interestingly, Annie can also come out of
        her Titan’s nape to create a hardened crystal cocoon around herself for protective purposes. During the 57th
        Exterior Scouting Mission Arc, Mikasa succeeds in slicing the Female Titan's fingers off, allowing Eren to rip
        the Titan form apart, although he had begun to merge before Levi stops him and stops the process.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="jaw-titan">
      <h3>Jaw Titan</h3>
      <img
        src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/the-jaw-titan-attack-on-titan.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=767&dpr=1.5"
        alt="Jaw titan">
      <p>
        As indicated by its name, the Titan type called the Jaw Titan possesses a powerful set of jaws that can tear
        through almost anything with incredible ease, even if it is considered to be the <a target="_blank"
          href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-jaw-weakest-shifter-not-cart/">weakest of Attack on
          Titan's Titan Shifters.</a> Currently in possession of Falco, the Jaw Titan can move fast enough to catch some
        of the Nine off-guard and cause severe damage to armored opponents by crushing them between its jaws. Those who
        held the power of the Jaw Titan demonstrated an incredible amount of speed and agility, especially in terrains
        such as Titan Forests, even to the point of catching some of the other Nine Titans off guard. However, the jaw
        manifests in slightly varying forms with respect to different users, such as Ymir only having hardened teeth,
        while Falco and Marcel's sport hardened, armored masks and jaw plating that is almost bulletproof. Also, Falco’s
        Jaw Titan has the ability to sprout wings and a tail, allowing it to take flight whilst carrying people on its
        body.

          href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-war-hammer-powers-origin-explained/">Attack on Titan's War Hammer
          Titan has powers</a> that allow it to
        produce and manipulate structures made of hardened Titan flesh, weaponizing them in the form of spikes and
        blades with serrated edges. Theo Magath states at one point that while a formidable asset, the War Hammer
        Titan’s structural hardening should be used in moderation, as constant usage can deplete the user of stamina.
        However, unlike the rest of the Nine, the War Hammer Titan can remove its control center from its nape,
        connecting the Titan and the host with a long cable of flesh. The War Hammer Titan can also emerge upon
        transformation without its operator inside its nape, which is a unique ability that the rest of the Nine in
        Attack on Titan are devoid of.
