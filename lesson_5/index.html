          Each Hashira is allowed to customize their uniform. The standard <a
            href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/anime/why-leader-demon-slayer-corps-blind" target="_blank">Demon Slayer
            Corps</a> uniform
          consists of a highly
          durable and lightweight material that cannot be damaged easily. They look similar to Gakuran uniforms and are
          paired with white belt and hakama pants. Additionally, a demon slayer is supposed to wear a white long-sleeved
          collared shirt under the uniform.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, as evident from the series, each <a
            href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/anime/demon-slayer-every-hashira-ranked-order-died"
            target="_blank">Hashira</a> looks different in their uniform. The truth is
          that Hashira
          are allowed to customize their uniform. While their standard uniform does have a difference, i.e., gold
          buttons
          instead of white buttons, the Hashira also tend to make their own customizations.

          Firstly, the main reason for the distinct look of most Hashira is their unique Haori. Except for and
          <span>Tengen Uzui</span>, all Hashira don one. As for the ones that do wear them, the Haori have a unique
          pattern that hints at their Breathing Styles.

          Out of the nine Hashira, five of them are known to customize their Uniform. <span>Sanemi Shinazugawa and
            Gyomei Himejima</span> have minor customization to their uniforms. They only have their buttons open. While
          Gyomei has a few
          buttons opened from the top, Shinazugawa has his entire chest exposed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The other three Hashira to customize their uniforms are <span>Tengen Uzui, Mitsuri Kanroji, and Muichiro
            Tokito.</span>
          Tengen Uzui is known to have the most flashy-looking Demon Slayer uniform. While some Hashira do have the
          turquoise version of the standard uniform, Tengen wears a sleeveless version of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, he dons one gold ring each on the bicep and wrist of his both arms. Lastly, he can also be seen
          wearing turquoise-colored fingerless gloves beneath the gold rings on his wrists.

          As for <a

            target="_blank">Mitsuri Kanroji</a>, she has a few buttons on her uniform open near her chest. Also, instead
          of wearing the standard uniform hakama pants, she dons a pleated skirt of the same color. Additionally, she
          wears navy blue thigh-high socks layered with the vertically striped lime-green socks gifted to her by Obanai
          Iguro.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, while Muichiro Tokito's uniform is quite similar to the standard turquoise version of the uniform, its
          sleeves and pants aren't pleated, making it look more like a kimono. While the reason for the same hasn't been
          revealed, it must have something to do with <span class="wrong">his stature.</span>
